# face-tacking-sigmu

This project was made at the Wolox Hackathon on 2019. We won the "Best Proyect" award.

This is only one part of the full project, with this you can track your face and use gestures to activate things, for for instance we use it to interact with a menu. If you are interested in this, you can try to comunicate with me.

Cheers!
